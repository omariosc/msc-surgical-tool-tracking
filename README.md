# Surgical Skill Improvements through AI-driven Training Enhancements

This is a private repository for the MSc in my PhD project: "Surgical Skill Improvements through AI-driven Training Enhancements".

## Datasets

Ideas for datasets include:

- ART-Net (tooltip, masks, bounding box, detection)
- EndoVis 2015 (tooltip, pose, masks, bounding box)
- PETRAW (sensor, masks)
- SurgRIPE? (pose, masks)
- EndoVis 2018? (masks)

### Our In-House Dataset for Testing

- 6DOF (sensor)

### Sub-optimal Datasets

- ATLAS Dione (bounding boxes)
- m2cai16-tool-locations (bounding boxes)
